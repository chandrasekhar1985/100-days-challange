# 100 Days Hacking Challenge 🚀

## Day 4 – Subdomain Enumeration & Attack Surface Discovery

On Day 4, I analyzed a scenario where a company had heavily secured its main website, but hidden vulnerabilities existed in its subdomains.  
During the assessment, I discovered that **forgotten and less-monitored subdomains** often expose the real attack surface.

### What I Learned

Subdomain enumeration is a technique used to discover additional assets related to a main domain. These assets are frequently overlooked during security hardening.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 🔹 Subdomain Enumeration
- The process of identifying subdomains linked to a primary domain
- Helps expand the visible attack surface
- Common in penetration testing and bug bounty hunting

### 🔹 Why Subdomains Are Vulnerable
- Often lack regular security updates
- May host older or legacy applications
- Security controls are weaker than the main website

### 🔹 Common Findings on Subdomains
- Exposed admin panels
- Test or staging environments
- Development servers
- Legacy applications

### 🔹 Role in Real-World Breaches
- Attackers target the weakest entry point
- Subdomains provide indirect access paths
- Frequently used for lateral movement

## Investigation Value
- Reveals hidden assets
- Improves asset inventory
- Helps organizations secure overlooked systems
- Reduces real-world breach risks

## Key Takeaway
A well-secured main website does not guarantee overall security.  
Subdomains often become the weakest link and a primary entry point during cyber attacks.

📘 *Security is only as strong as the least protected asset.*
