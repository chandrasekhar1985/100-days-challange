# 100 Days Hacking Challenge 🚀

## Day 1 – Understanding the Basics of Ethical Hacking

I started this challenge believing hacking was about shortcuts and illegal tricks shown in movies.  
Day 1 completely changed my perspective.

### What I Learned:
- Real hacking begins with **white-hat fundamentals**
- What **bug bounty hunting** actually involves
- Difference between **penetration testing** and random attacks
- How **computer networking** works behind the scenes
- Understanding **client–server architecture**
- How **data packets travel** across networks
- Roles of different **types of servers**

### Key Takeaway:
Strong fundamentals are essential.  
This is the same foundation used by **cybersecurity professionals and cybercrime investigators** before using any tools.

📘 *Learning before hacking. Ethics before execution.*
