## Day 3 – WHOIS Lookup & OSINT Investigation

On Day 3, I investigated a fake cryptocurrency investment website that promised unrealistic returns.  
Instead of making assumptions, I performed a **WHOIS lookup** to gather factual information about the domain.

### What I Discovered Using WHOIS
- Domain registrar details
- Hosting provider information
- Domain registration and expiration dates
- Registrant contact information (when available)

This showed me how **WHOIS acts as a starting point for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) investigations**.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 🔹 WHOIS Lookup
- A public database that stores domain registration details
- Helps identify who owns or manages a domain
- Often used in cyber investigations and fraud analysis

### 🔹 Role of WHOIS in OSINT
- First step in investigating suspicious or scam websites
- Provides verifiable technical information
- Helps avoid guessing and assumptions

### 🔹 Identifying Scam Networks
- Similar registration details can link multiple fake websites
- Same registrar or hosting provider may be reused
- Patterns help uncover larger scam operations

### 🔹 Evidence Preservation
- Registration dates help establish timelines
- Domain details support investigation reports
- Useful for legal, security, and research purposes

## Key Takeaway
WHOIS lookups provide critical intelligence during investigations.  
They help trace scam infrastructure, connect related domains, and preserve evidence using publicly available data.

📘 *Effective investigations begin with accurate information, not assumptions.*
