# 100 Days Hacking Challenge 🚀

## Day 2 – IP Addressing, DNS, Ports & Protocols

During a real-world investigation scenario, tracking suspicious login activity helped me understand the importance of IP addresses in cybersecurity.

On Day 2, I learned about:
- **IPv4 and IPv6** and their differences
- **Public and private IP ranges**
- **Domain names and domain structure**
- The role and importance of **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- **Ports** and how they identify running services
- **Protocols** that define how systems communicate

### Key Concepts Learned

### 🔹 IP Addresses
- Unique identifiers for devices on a network
- Used to trace suspicious activity and attack sources
- Critical for network monitoring and investigations

### 🔹 IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (limited)
- IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (expanded space)
- IPv6 improves scalability and efficiency

### 🔹 Public vs Private IPs
- Private IPs are used inside local networks
- Public IPs are visible on the internet
- NAT connects private networks to the public internet

### 🔹 Domain Names & Structure
- Human-readable names for websites
- Structured into subdomain, domain, and TLD
- Important for understanding web infrastructure

### 🔹 DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates domain names into IP addresses
- Acts as the internet’s phonebook
- Common target in cyber attacks

### 🔹 Ports
- Identify specific services on a system
- Examples:  
  - 80 – HTTP  
  - 443 – HTTPS  
  - 22 – SSH
- Used in service discovery and scanning

### 🔹 Protocols
- Rules for data transmission
- TCP ensures reliable communication
- UDP offers faster, connectionless communication
- HTTP/HTTPS power web traffic

### Key Takeaway
Understanding IP addressing, DNS, ports, and protocols is essential for tracing attackers, identifying exposed services, and analyzing how systems communicate over the internet.
